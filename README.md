# Follow the Plot II

## Plan 1

I will experiment with movement, tracing paths between moving
entities. Connected agents will move across a plane and occassionally
lines will be drawn between them. These projects will develop a
language for describing these agents and help to develop an intuition
around their interactions.

## Plan 2

I will work with radial lines drawn outward from a point. I will
define areas of activity (by distance, angle etc) and only draw in
those areas. I will combine drawings with slightly different points to
create overlapping figures.

## Plan 3

I will experiment with intersecting lines. This will allow me to
define ordered layers and create logic around intersections.

## Plan 4

I will experiment with ranges that are divided by various random
means.

## Plan 5

I will experiment with distorting grids in different ways.

## Plan 6

I will experiment with different line styles.
